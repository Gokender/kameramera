Library of useful tools for analog cameras (but also for more recent ones).

The goal of this project is to gather all useful information that can be found to help the photographer when using his camera.

The library is divided in several parts to manage different components.

### Lightmeter

This tool is used to simulate a lightmeter. It is based on 4 variables : 
- the shutter speed
- the aperture
- film speed
- illuminance

It allows you to choose one of the optimal parameters according to the 3 others.
